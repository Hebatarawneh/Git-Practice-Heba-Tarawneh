# Git & GitHub Basics

## 1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

- **Git** is a version control system used locally to track changes in code.
- **GitHub** is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides tools for collaboration and sharing.

## 2. Explain the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`.

- `git fetch` downloads updates from the remote repository **without merging** them into your current branch.
- `git pull` downloads updates **and automatically merges** them into your current branch.

## 3. What is the purpose of the `.gitignore` file?

- The `.gitignore` file is used to specify files and folders that Git should ignore and not track, such as:
  - Temporary files  
  - Python cache files (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`)  
  - Environment configurations  
  - OS/system files (like `.DS_Store` or `Thumbs.db`)

## 4. Steps to contribute to an open-source project on GitHub:

1. **Fork** the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone** the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
3. **Create a new branch** for your changes.
4. Make your changes and **commit** them using `git commit`.
5. **Push** the new branch to your GitHub repository.
6. **Open a Pull Request** to the original repository for review and merging.
